Description

	This program creates wave files using data entered, by typing the frequency and amount of waves to have. The wave file created can be used as a bass tester, or you can create a sample for a music project you may be working on. You can use any part of my code you want without my permission.

	Recent comments some people have made about very low frequencies wreck your speakers by burning out the coil. I beleive this is not true, I have used this bass tester both on my 6*9 250W speakers and my 15" 600W clarion powered by a 1200watt amp. I have used may other bass testers with my sound system, and it has not lost any of its sound quality or bass reponse. 
	The fact is that for a good sound system, your amplifier and speakers need to match. For most people who have hooked up their Hi-Fi systems, The amplifier in the Hi-Fi system matches the speakers rating so therefore The maximum power that your amplifier puts out is equal to the speakers full potential (with a bit of a safety margin added). But for those other people like me, who has hooked up a car amplifier to my computer together with 6*9's and a 15" sub, you may want to be careful if you have, say two 150watt 6*9's with a huge 1000watt amp, because the amp is capable of many times the rating of the 6*9's. But even a 1000watt amp will have trouble wrecking a 100w speaker.
	I once had an old 6" 5Watt speaker that i didn't need so me and my friend decided to turn up the volume until it stopped working. I hooked it up to my 1200watt amp, the speaker was first working ok. When we turned the volume up to half way (ie. 600W), the speaker was distorting hard!! After turning the volume up fully for atleast 5mins the coil started to smoke and then all at once the speaker stopped playing sound altogether. This, I think, will imply that it will be impossible to destroy my 600watt clarion with this bass tester since a worthless 5watt 2ohm speaker held up to 1200watts for atleast 5mins, and hence my bass tester is perfectly safe to use. All I'm really trying to say is, if you hear your speaker distorting, turn it down and your speaker will be fine!!
	Ofcause, if you are not entirely sure about what I have just told you above, Then don't use my program. For the rest of you Bass freaks out there, this program is for you!! You can set the frequencies so low that you can watch your speaker move in and out slowly!! Have Fun!!

Trouble Shooting

	"I hear a really soft clicking noise when I play the wave file" - That is because the sine waves don't match up perfectly in my code (i.e their gradients at 2*pi), When you use
equalisers and filters this can make this noise loud enough to be noticeable. Use a simple 
program like goldwave (The best sound editing tool I've ever used) and remove all frequencies over say 500Hz.
